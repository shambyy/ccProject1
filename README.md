**Code Running and Description:**
"Zipping"

Once run, the code should prompt the user for their starting size preference (big or small). 
At making a selection, the program will show them the verbal resulting Markov chain results. 
One can be aware that it is more likely for small to follow small and big to follow big, 
but there is still room for change as according to the matrix within the code. 

These verbal results will simultaneously be translated into a gif of a moving ball. 
This new gif is time stamped and will appear in the same folder as the program itself.
Note: the gif does not automatically appear, so I normally keep my folder open to the side. 
One then has access to the animated gif as well as a few frames to visualize what is happening.
The pink ball will zip across the screen in different sizes and loop continuously. 

**Personal:**
I do a lot of my planning and scheduling within the Notion app, and also organize gifs on my phone screen. 
I really liked the idea of learning to make a gif, and so it was great getting to learn to use PIL.
There's something really refreshing to me about something cute on my screen that moves; 
it gives my devices a more lifelike quality. 
Not only was this a great refresher in Python, but this is the first piece of digital art I have ever made!
I think I've gained a lot of appreciation towards animation, and am curious about smoother design techniques.

Also, I have to admit that part of the appeal in attempting to build a Markov responsive gif was to spite my sister.
She's the most talented artist I know, but when I asked her for advice on starting this, 
she told me I would be out of my depth with any kind of dynamic, moving art. 
Sure, she was right, but now I can send her this gif and at least know that I can make pretty,pink pixels wiggle a little bit. 

**Challenges:**
Knocking off the Python cobwebs was one thing, but my biggest problem was probably my ambition. 
I assumed animating a drawing of my own would involve a few copies of the same art, 
and that they would need to move around my screen a little, but that wasn't the case at all. 
Creating digital art with code was incredibly testing. It's nothing like a quick doodle. 
I again was challenged with having to force my computer to understand my wantsâ€“the worst part.

I think the trickiest part was merging my Markov section with the actual art creating section. 
I definitely was repetitive with several functions, and need to review accessing functions appropriately;
I'd completely forgotten about local and global variables being tricky. Also, as I'd never
worked with PIL before, there were not many gif building resources. Tough. 

Taking time away from coding this past year also definitely made for a horrible search history;
I kept forgetting how to do the most simple things. I kept trying to java it up!
This brought me back to Python, thankfully. More importantly, I'm thinking more about oop,
and know I need to be more organized next time. I also need to review how to implement and access
helper functions. More largely, I also need to get more comfortable with GitHub. 

The biggest next step is to practice, practice, practice. You're certainly helping with that;
our group is meeting tomorrow to discuss the next project. I know it'll be really stressful
navigating that and GHC together, but I hope to pull it off somehow. 

**Creative:**
Yes! It's colorful, it changes sizes based on the user's guidance, and it moves!
I'm quite easily entertained, and will definitely pop it onto my phone screen.
